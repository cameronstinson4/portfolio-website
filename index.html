                        I wish that shotgun was my penis. Why'd you even rope me into this?! Aw, man! I really liked this life! Well, at least I
                        didn't really crap my pants. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of
                        ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit!
                        Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long
                        time coming, anyways.

                        You created a day care for my dad? Not so fast Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty. Just you
                        and me. And sometimes your sister, and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You wanna know why,
                        Morty? Because he crossed me. Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures.
                        First thing that's different? No more dad, Morty. Life is effort and I'll stop when I die!

                        to yourself. We are created to serve a singular purpose, for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill!
